# -Design-and-implementation-of-Dual-Clock-Asynchronous-FIFO
Designed Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL and performed simulation in ModelSim .   Synchronization of FIFO pointers is accomplished using Gray Code to avoid multi-bit signal transitions.   Implemented Two Flip-Flop Synchronizer to avoid meta-stability issues in CDC.
